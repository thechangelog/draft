# 1000 Day Love Story With Ember

Like most love stories, my love affair with Ember took time to blossom. I first saw Ember in 2011, had some fun, and planned to look at it once the API solidified.

In that time, pre-1.0, Ember's API would change constantly. Most people saw this as a flaw, after all, it meant that documentation, blogs, and stack overflow searches would frequently reference older versions. The router saw the biggest changes, frequently.

The benefit of this -- Ember got the API right. Once it hit 1.0, the API was on point; and with the correct API in place, Ember keeps getting better. Ember is able to make changes under the hood, applying React style rendering, performance enhancements, and generally get better and better over time.

My experience with ember is generally along the lines of Deleting more code than I add; Ember tends to add what I need overtime and I use that instead of my code.

Told over a series of many (perhaps too many) tweets, here is the story of my transition from Ember to Angular to Ember.

### 2011

### 2012

I live-coded some ember at Houston Code Camp and it didn't go very well. Too many rough edges, mostly with ember-data.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Speaking of <a href="https://twitter.com/houstoncodecamp">@houstoncodecamp</a>, I&#39;ll be live coding an <a href="https://twitter.com/emberjs">@emberjs</a> app with rails as the API.

### 2013

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tehviking">@tehviking</a> I like that viewpoint. (I like both angular and ember)</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/322376953564901377">April 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Love both angular and ember. excited to see which ages better.</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/372472103984848896">August 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/garrettdimon">@garrettdimon</a> angular fits into your rails app. Your rails all fits into ember.&#10;Both great. Ember takes more thought, may be better long run</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/371643939960279040">August 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

During 2013, JB and I wrote and published [AngularJS + Rails](http://www.angularails.com/). Angular was very pragmatic and got some things done. Others, like directives and services, seemed half-baked.


### 2014

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Realtalk?src=hash">#Realtalk</a> Sooo jb and I bet on angular, with good success; my timeline is full of ember-love and I&#39;m planning to revisit embah.</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/449647197249101826">March 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

I read about the community love at EmberConf 2014 and was insta-jealous. I remember what I love about Rails and Ruby was the community; decide to revist Ember in earnest and see how things are rolling along.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/iwarshak">@iwarshak</a> to be honest, I’m amazed at ember now vs nov 2012.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hkarthik">@hkarthik</a> yep, I use both now. Angular to enhance an existing app. Ember for greenfield.</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/498928611714281472">August 11, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Preview of <a href="https://twitter.com/emberjs">@emberjs</a> app I built for my college fantasy football draft. So simple. So fast. So easy.

I dive into ember-cli; it's the final piece of the ember puzzle. Followed by ember-addons and quite simply amazing.

### 2015

Angular announced their 2.0 backward compatibility breakathon apocalypse. I finalize what's been happening for a year, and break up with Angular for Ember. #sorrynotsorry

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Watching Portlandia, getting moar excitet about <a href="https://twitter.com/EmberConf">@EmberConf</a> which OH BTW is is Portland. :boom:</p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/566047213143343104">February 13, 2015</a></blockquote>

EmberConf 2015. Such amazing awesomeness.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>A collection of links that cover what happened during EmberConf 2015. <a href="https://t.co/IYZvxBwlWN">https://t.co/IYZvxBwlWN</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emberconf?src=hash">#emberconf</a>  :: amaze. thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_">@sugarpirate_</a></p>&mdash; Jesse Wolgamott (@jwo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwo/status/573504125637279744">March 5, 2015</a></blockquote>

Can't wait to see what happens in 2015 and beyond.

PS. The actual 1000 days is Tue, 09 Sep 2014; I had built my 3rd app by this time. I doubt it'll take you 1000 days to fall in love. Want to try? Check out the [CodeSchool Course](http://ember.codeschool.com), [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/), and the [ember guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/).

PPS: I created this using a combination of [t](https://github.com/sferik/t) and the [twitter archive](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive). (t only returned 3200 tweets in a search).
